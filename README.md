Usage
-----
--NOTE-- Currently copying files directly from mobile using ADB is in development stage, 
till it is completed you can copy files from you phone(song files from-- /data/data/com.google.music/files/music 
and database-- /data/data/com.google.music/database/music.db ) to your pc and use commands given in help section.

1. Root your phone and install _BusyBox_ (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox).
   You can skip this step if you are using CyanogenMod or other ROM that already includes BusyBox
2. Enable _Developer options_ by clicking 7x on _Build number_ in Settings -> About phone
3. Enable _USB debugging_ in Settings -> Developer options
4. Connect your phone to computer with USB cable
5. If you have any firewall on your PC, you must first allow inbound traffic to TCP port 23456
6. Run `playmusicextractor destination_dir` (your MP3 files will be downloaded and decrypted to destination_dir folder)
7. Confirm _Allow USB debugging_ dialog and then superuser permissions request for _ADB shell_ (on your phone)
